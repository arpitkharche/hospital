		question: "What causes varicose & Spider veins?",
		answer: "Spider veins and varicose veins are caused by structural abnormalities of blood vessels. Veins carry blood back to the heart from other parts of the body. They utilize a series of one-way valves to avoid backflow of blood. For a variety of reasons, these valves can become defective, allowing the backflow of blood within veins. The subsequent pooling of blood and pressure increase within the vein, and weakens the blood vessel wall. Spider veins and varicose veins then develop from the engorgement and dilation of the affected blood vessels.",

It is important to see the right expert because it is equally important to know when to start the treatment. In early disease, depending on the clinical examination and a good doppler study, the expert will usually recommend appropriate stockings for prevention. It is also necessary to know the right time to proceed to intervening into definite treatment to prevent complications. The technique used by Interventional radiologists are some of the most advanced and have proven to have given best results to the patient. Interventional radiologists are specially trained to perform all treatment procedures related to varicose veins. Most treatments performed by them provide immediate relief to the patient and enable resuming normal life with minimal rest period.

		question: "What is Peripheral Arterial disease (PAD)?",
		answer: "PAD is a circulatory issue. Narrowed arteries restrict blood flow to the limbs. This occurs more commonly in the lower legs. The limbs do not receive enough blood to keep up with the demands of day-to-day use, resulting in pain when walking. The condition can reduce blood flow to the heart and brain.",

It also decreases the oxygen and nutrients available to the tissue. Blood clots may form on the artery walls, further decreasing the inner size of the blood vessel and block off major arteries."

		question: "What is the prognosis for peripheral arterial disease if left Untreated?",
		answer: "The longer you wait, the fewer treatment options will be available."
				"Many PAD treatment options, such as atherectomy, stenting, and angioplasty, are minimally invasive procedures that can often restore full mobility within a week of treatment. However, these treatment options may not be an option in advanced stages of PAD, when the blockage hardens, is spread over large areas, or is in areas too difficult to access. Severe PAD may require bypass graft surgery, which is an invasive surgical procedure with a longer recovery period and more risks. At its latest stages, amputation of the limb with the blocked blood vessel may be the only option to treat PAD."
				"Some people assume that since their doctor isn’t bringing up peripheral artery disease, it must not be an issue. Risk for PAD increases with age, but can still be found in middle-aged adults. In fact, 1 in 20 adults over the age of 50 have PAD. If you are a smoker, diabetic, or possess any other risk factor for PAD, your chances of experiencing PAD at a younger age are drastically increased.iv"

				"PAD symptoms will worsen over time without medical and/or lifestyle interventions."
				"PAD is caused by a buildup of plaque within the arteries. The first symptom of PAD is usually pain after walking for a moderate distance, which resolves after a short period of rest. Because the pain resolves itself, patients with PAD will frequently adopt a more sedentary lifestyle, to avoid the discomfort of physical activity. However, over time, the buildup of plaque will worsen, restricting blood supply further until there is discomfort walking shorter and shorter distances, and eventually, many people even experience pain at rest."
				"The longer you wait, the more expensive, invasive, and inconvenient the treatment will get."
				"In addition to the increased invasiveness and risks associated with bypass graft surgery in the leg and limb amputation, advanced stage PAD treatments also have longer recovery times, extensive hospital stays, and require physical therapy to return to an independent lifestyle. When compared to a minimally invasive treatment like an angioplasty, there is far less expense, and patients can many times return to work and their normal activities in as little as two days.vi PAD can lead to gangrene."
				"Peripheral artery disease occurs as a result of blockage of the blood vessels that supply blood to the lower extremities. This blood carries valuable oxygen to nourish the tissues and keep them healthy. When that blood supply is depleted, tissue decomposes, and can result in gangrene. This gangrenous tissue can be both limb- and life-threatening, and should be treated immediately.PAD can lead to amputation.",

		question: "How is PAD Diagnosed?",
		answer: "Along with a complete medical history and physical exam, other tests may include:"
				"•	Ankle-brachial index (ABI). An ABI is a comparison of the blood pressure in the ankle with the blood pressure in the arm using a regular blood pressure cuff and a Doppler ultrasound device. To determine the ABI, the systolic blood pressure (the top number of the blood pressure measurement) of the ankle is divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm."
				"•	Doppler ultrasound flow studies. This uses high-frequency sound waves and a computer to create images of blood vessels, tissues, and organs. Your doctor may use the Doppler technique to measure and assess the flow of blood. Faintness or absence of sound may mean blood flow is blocked."
				"•	Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This noninvasive test uses a combination of a large magnet, radio frequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures in the body. Your doctor injects a special dye during the procedure so that blood vessels are more visible."
				"•	Computerized tomography angiography (CTA). A CTA imaging test shows the doctor an image of the blood vessels, including areas that have narrowed or become blocked."
				"•	Angiogram. This is an X-ray of the arteries and veins to detect blockage or narrowing. This procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into an artery in the leg and injecting a contrast dye. The contrast dye makes the arteries and veins visible on the X-ray."
				"The above are primarily used to diagnose PVDs. Ankle-Brachial Index is very inexpensive test and should be adopted earlier before getting other tests done.",

		question: "What is the treatment of PAD and Which Doctor to see?",
		answer: "A major problem with PVD/PAD is that almost 50% of patient do not show symptoms. In cases where the patients do show symptoms, many a times it is brushed aside as the symptoms appear generic and an expert doctor is not consulted in time."
				"A delayed diagnosis and delay in treatment can result into extreme complications. If you are experiencing any problem as mentioned in symptoms section above immediately consult an interventional radiologist as they are best trained to treat PVDs."
				"If you do not have any symptoms as but have any heart disease, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, or any kidney disease you should regularly get yourself checked for PVD. All people above age 50 years are also highly recommended for evaluation on regular basis."
				"You can connect with us to get more information on PVDs. We would be happy to provide advice and guidance."

				"A ) Medicines"
				"A medicine called clopidogrel is usually advised. This does not help with symptoms of PAD but helps to prevent blood clots (thromboses) forming in blood vessels (arteries). It does this by reducing the stickiness of platelets in the bloodstream. If you cannot take clopidogrel then alternative antiplatelet medicines such as low-dose aspirin may be advised."
				"A statin medicine is usually advised to lower your cholesterol level. This helps to prevent a build-up of fatty patches (atheroma)."
				"If you have diabetes then good control of your blood sugar (glucose) level will help to prevent PAD from worsening."
				"If you have high blood pressure (hypertension) then you will normally be advised to take medication to lower it."
				"Other medicines are sometimes used to try to open up the arteries - for example, cilostazol and naftidrofuryl. One may be given and may help. However, they do not work in all cases. Therefore, there is no point in continuing with these medicines if you do not notice an improvement in symptoms within a few weeks."
				"A)	Endovascular Treatment"
				"The treatment of PAD can reduce your symptoms, improve your quality of life, reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke, and prevent worsening conditions. Left untreated, PAD can worsen and often become life-threatening."
				"Our treatment goal is to restore blood flow to your limbs by minimizing the narrowing of the arteries. We offer minimally-invasive treatment options called:"
				"1) Angioplasty"
				"2) Stent Placement"
				"3) Atherectomy"
				"ANGIOPLASTY:"
				"Angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that opens narrowed or blocked blood vessels supplying blood to your legs. A balloon-tipped catheter (a thin hollow tube) will be inserted into a blood vessel in your upper thigh area (called the groin). This is often referred to as a “pin-hole incision.” The catheter is positioned in the narrowed or blocked artery by using a continuous x-ray guidance.When the catheter is in place, the balloon inflates for short amount of time. The plaque is compressed outward against the artery wall, widening the artery and restoring the blood flow. Next, the balloon is deflated and the catheter is removed from your body"
				"STENT PLACEMENT:"
				"Stents are commonly implanted during the balloon angioplasty procedure. A stent is a flexible, metal, mesh tube that expands to hold open the impacted artery. Stents provide internal structural support to better maintain proper circulation and will remain in the previously blocked vessel.Local anesthesia or moderated sedation is administered at the beginning of the procedure to provide enough sedation to make the procedure as comfortable as possible. You will be awake the entire time! "
				"ATHERECTOMY:"
				"Artherectomy uses a catheter and x-ray guidance, similar to the angioplasty and stent placement. Instead of inserting a balloon, however, the atherectomy catheter has a sharp blade at its end designed to remove and collect plaque from your blood vessel. The catheter is taken out of the vessel once sufficient plaque is removed. ",

	{
		id: 4,
		question: "What is a fistula?",
		answer: "The most desirable form of hemodialysis vascular access is called a fistula. To make a fistula, a surgeon connects an artery to a vein in the forearm or upper arm. With time, usually one to three months, the vein enlarges and becomes ready to receive the needles used to withdraw and replace blood during dialysis. A fistula can last for many years if the vein enlarges and the fistula "develops". About three-quarters of fistulas develop or mature. During the time that a fistula is developing, if hemodialysis is necessary, another form of vascular access will be necessary, usually a catheter.",

	},
	{
		id: 5,
		question: "What is a dialysis graft?",
		answer: "In some patients, the arteries and/or veins are not suitable for making a fistula. In these patients, a shunt (or graft) can be used as an alternative form of dialysis access. A graft is a piece of plastic tubing that is inserted by a surgeon and connects the artery to the vein. Unlike fistulas, grafts do not need to "develop" and are ready for use in most instances by four weeks after placement. A catheter may be necessary for dialysis during this waiting period. The disadvantage of grafts is that they do not last nearly as long as fistulas and can develop narrowing and clotting more frequently. In addition, grafts can get infected -- something which does not happen very often with fistulas."
                "Just as with fistulas, narrowing veins with grafts can be detected before they clot if the appropriate screening techniques are used. These include self-examination, measuring flows during dialysis with a special machine, and checkups by an interventional radiologist. Once an abnormality is detected, you need to be scheduled to have it treated by Interventional Radiology as quickly as possible. It is very important that patients keep their appointments with Interventional Radiology so that clotting does not occur. If clotting does occur it can be treated by an interventional radiologist."

The advantage of the permacath is that it can provide access to the vascular system for up to one year. This is important for dialysis patients because they will avoid multiple catheter insertions, which could eventually lead to vein damage."

				"PERMCATH procedure"
				"Using an X-Ray machine and small surgical tools, the surgeon places the permacath in the jugular vein. The permacath is moved under the skin throughout the upper chest, under the collarbone, and the end of the catheter comes out on the chest wall. The X-Ray is used in order for the surgeon to follow the path of the catheter throughout the procedure and make sure it is placed correctly.Risks include puncturing the lung, bleeding, and infection.",

		"We as Vascular and Interventional radiologist offer the following ways to establish and maintain your dialysis access."
			"A)	AV Fistula Angioplasty and Stenting"
			"Using imaging guidance, an inflatable balloon mounted at the tip of a catheter is inserted through the skin into the fistula or graft and advanced to the blockage. There, the balloon is inflated and deflated. In this process, the balloon expands the vein or artery wall, increasing blood flow through the fistula or graft. A stent may be placed to hold the vessel open."

			"B)	AV Fistula declotting Endovascular Treatment"
			"Catheter-directed thrombectomy or thrombolysis: Using x-ray guidance and a contrast material that helps show the blood vessel, your interventional radiologist will insert a catheter through the skin into a vessel (artery or vein) and direct it to the thrombosis, or blockage. The blood clot will then be dissolved in one of two ways:"

				"Caratheter-directed Thrombolysis:"
					"•	Catheter-directed thrombolysis can greatly improve blood flow and reduce or eliminate the related symptoms and effects without the need for more invasive surgery."
					"•	Thrombolysis is a safe, highly effective way of re-establishing circulation blocked by a clot."
					"•	Thrombolysis is less invasive than conventional open surgery to remove clots and the hospital stay is relatively brief. Blood loss is less than with traditional surgical treatment and there is no obvious surgical incision."
				"Risks"
					"•	Any procedure where the skin is penetrated carries a risk of infection. The chance of infection requiring antibiotic treatment appears to be less than one in 1,000."
					"•	There is a very slight risk of an allergic reaction if contrast material is injected."

					"The only proven potentially curative therapy for HCC remains surgery, either liver resection or liver transplantation, and patients with a single small HCC (<5 cm) or up to three lesions <3 cm should be considered for assessment for these treatment options."
					"Surgical resection aims to remove a tumour together with surrounding liver tissue while preserving enough remaining liver for normal body function. This treatment offers the best prognosis for long-term survival, but unfortunately only 10-15% of patients with HCC are suitable for surgical resection. This is often due to extensive disease or poor liver function. Liver surgery in cirrhotic patients carries high morbidity and mortality.  The overall recurrence rate after resection is approximately 50-60%."
					"Liver transplantation may also be considered in any patient with cirrhosis and a small (5 cm or less single nodule or up to three lesions of 3 cm or less) HCC. Liver transplantation aims to replace the diseased liver with a cadaveric liver (from a deceased patient) or a living donor graft.   Patients with active hepatitis B virus (HBV) had a worse outlook due to HBV recurrence and were previously not considered candidates for transplantation. Effective antiviral therapy is now available and HBV positive patients with a small HCC, as defined above, can be assessed for transplantation."
					"Hepatic resection should be considered as primary treatment in any patient with HCC and a non-cirrhotic liver (including fibrolamellar HCC – a specific subtype of HCC that tends to occur in livers without cirrhosis).  Resection can be carried out in highly selected patients with cirrhosis and well preserved liver function who are unsuitable for liver transplantation."
				"Non-surgical treatment of HCC"
					"Non-surgical therapy should be used where surgical therapy is not possible."
					"Chemoembolisation can produce tumour necrosis (tissue death) and has been shown to affect survival in highly selected patients with good liver reserve. Chemoembolisation is also effective therapy for pain or bleeding from HCC."
					"Radiofrequency ablation has been shown to produce necrosis (tissue death) of small HCCs. It is best suited to peripheral lesions, less than 3 cm in diameter."

		question: "What is TARE/SIRT?",
		answer: "Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT)"
				"What is SIRT?"
				"Both HCC and colorectal metastases are sensitive to radiation therapy (radiotherapy) but the side effects incurred from external beam radiotherapy are generally too high to tolerate.  SIRT is the process of intra-arterial injection of millions of microspheres each approximately 35 microns (one-third the diameter of a strand of hair), which are bonded to yttrium-90 (Y-90), a radioactive pure beta emitter with a physical half-life of about two-and-a-half days. The microspheres become trapped in the tumour's blood supply, where they destroy the tumour by reducing blood flow and induce local radiation damage to the cellular DNA of the liver lesion. The radiation is contained within the patient's body, and is continually delivered over approximately two weeks, at which point the microspheres are no longer radioactive."
				"The spheres are delivered in a similar fashion to TACE via the femoral artery to the hepatic arteries and their branches. "
				"Healthy liver tissue receives most of its blood supply via the portal vein, whilst liver tumours gain the majority of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. Therefore catheterization of the hepatic artery permits the selective targeting of therapeutic material to the tumour."
				"What actually happens during SIRT?"
				"All patients should undergo baseline tumour evaluation with CT or MRI to identify tumour anatomy and the presence of complicating factors.  The procedure is performed within the interventional radiology suite and under sterile conditions. The technique is performed under sedation allows the patient to feel drowsy.  It is not the same as a general anaesthetic, in which the patient is unconscious."
				"The first part of the procedure involves puncture of the femoral artery (the main artery in the groin) after injection of local anaesthetic.  A guidewire is passed up into the aorta (the main artery of the body) and then to selectively catheterise the main arteries to the liver."
				"A catheter is then advanced super-selectively into the tumour/s and the SIRT yttrium-90 labelled microspheres are injected into the tumour’s blood supply. "
				"After embolisation, hepatic artery injection of radiolabelled albumin (a protein) is performed and a nuclear medicine lung scan is performed.  This is to exclude the presence of significant shunting between the liver and lung circulation in which case the treatment is dangerous due to a high risk of radiation induced lung injury.  If the nuclear medicine lung scan is satisfactory, then the patient returns in 1-2 weeks for administration of the yttrium-labelled spheres to the tumour via the hepatic artery.  Following the procedure, the femoral puncture site is usually compressed by hand or a specialised arterial closure device may be used."
				"Serious complications are rare but in some patients radiation hepatitis occurs due to excessive irradiation of the normal liver, which can lead to liver failure."
				"Possible restrictions to the use of SIRT"
				"SIRT may not be possible in patients who have/had:  Liver failure or severely abnormal liver function tests, ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), previous external beam radiotherapy to the liver, treatment with capecitabine (a chemotherapy agent) within the previous two months, or if capecitabine treatment is planned within 2 months of SIRT."
				"SIRT is not usually undertaken if there is evidence of extensive spread of tumour outside the liver."
				"SIRT would not generally be undertaken in patients where the extent of cancer within the liver is amenable to surgical resection.                      "

		question: "RFA",
		answer: "Percutaneous Ablation Techniques / Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)"
				"Another route to treat primary and secondary solid organ tumours is via direct ablation (using thermal energy to destroy cells and cause tumour necrosis.)  This is an evolving technique and has been used in liver, renal and lung tumours with some success."
				"Liver ablation techniques"
				"Percutaneous Ethanol Injection (PEI) was an early technique involving the injection of absolute ethanol (alcohol) directly into HCC lesions under ultrasound control and achieved satisfactory results in small tumours <3cm. Other techniques that have been used include cryoablation (freezing of tumours), microwave ablation, and laser techniques, but radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remains the predominant technique."
				"RFA has been approved by NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) for the treatment of unresectable HCC and colorectal hepatic metastases."
				"RFA – Mechanism of action"
				"RFA produces movement of ions in the tissue which results in heating and cellular death.  Heating to a temperature of 60-100°C results in almost immediate tissue damage."
				"RFA is based on producing tissue necrosis using a high-frequency alternating current that is delivered through an electrode placed in the centre of the tumour.  Tissue necrosis begins as the temperature approaches 60°C, and RFA treatments often result in local tissue temperatures that approach or exceed 100°C, which result in tumour cell death."
				"It is possible to treat single tumours of up to 5 cm in diameter, and multiple tumours of <3cm diameter. "

				"What actually happens during the procedure of RFA?"
				"RFA may be performed either under sedation or general anaesthesia.  The liver lesions will have been identified using either ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT), and the RFA procedure can be performed under either US or CT guidance, which is usually determined by the interventional radiologist prior to the procedure. "
				"The procedure would normally be performed in the CT scanner or the interventional radiology suite.  Once positioned upon the scanning table, the skin over the liver will be cleaned and sterilised and a sterile drape applied.   Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the overlying tissues and either sedation or general anaesthesia is required for pain relief during the procedure."
				"An insulated needle with an electrode at the tip is used which transmits high-frequency alternating current to the tumour tissue.  The needle electrode is inserted into the tumour usually under ultrasound guidance with CT to confirm the final position."
				"Following ablation of the tumour, continued heating of the needle on withdrawal or “track ablation” avoids spreading of tumour cells."
				"RF - Ablation Tumours - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcqAegf6q3w"
				"Restrictions to the use of RFA"
				"The following factors may mean that RFA cannot be performed:"
				"Significant evidence of cancer outside the liver, invasion of bile ducts or major vessels, liver cirrhosis or active infection. Difficult to access lesions (may be sometimes necessary to perform RFA under open or laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery.)"
				"Tumours that occupy >40% of the volume of the liver (the amount of liver left after RFA might not be sufficient to preserve liver function.)"
				"Close distance to important structures like vessels and nearby organs."
				"A relative contraindication may be if lesions are larger than 5 cm."
				"Complications of RFA"
				"Complications of RFA include haemorrhage, liver abscess, and heat injury to adjacent structures e.g. bowel and gallbladder.  The use of “hydrodissection” (the injection of dextrose solution to push away other nearby organs) can be used to avoid local complications or injury to other structures."
				"Results of RFA in HCC, either alone or in combination with TACE have been encouraging. ",

		question: "What is percutaneous biliary drainage?",
		answer: "Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is a procedure where a small, flexible, plastic tube is placed through the skin into the liver in order to drain an obstructed bile duct system. The liver produces bile which aids digestion of fats. The bile flows through a series of small tubes (ducts) that drain into one large duct called the common bile duct, which then empties into the duodenum, the first part of the small bowel after the stomach.  Bile is also stored in the gallbladder."
				"If the bile duct becomes blocked, the bile cannot drain normally and backs up in the liver.  Signs of blocked bile ducts include jaundice (yellowing of the skin), dark urine, light stools, itching, nausea and poor appetite.  This is a potentially serious condition that needs to be treated. It is possible to relieve the obstruction by inserting a fine plastic drainage tube (catheter) through the skin (percutaneous) into the obstructed bile duct, past the obstruction and into the duodenum by minimal invasion. "
				"This relieves the congestion in the blocked duct by allowing the bile to drain externally into a collecting bag as well as draining internally in the normal way. ",
		imagePath: "../img/card1.jpg"
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		question: "What is biliary stenting?",
		answer: "Sometimes the biliary drainage procedure needs to be extended with the placement of a permanent plastic or metal stent across the site of the bile duct blockage.  Stents are usually inserted in 2-3 days after the initial drainage procedure and they keep the narrowed duct open without the need for a catheter."
				"Stenting may be preceded or followed by biliary dilatation, which involves dilating a segment of bile duct with a balloon to open up the stricture. ",
		imagePath: "../img/card1.jpg"
	},
	{
		id: 3,
		question: "What are the indications for percutaneous biliary drainage and stenting? ",
		answer: "The most common indication for biliary drainage is blockage or narrowing (stricture) of the bile ducts.  There are several conditions that may cause this including:"
					"•	Gallstones – in the gallbladder or within the bile ducts"
					"•	Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)"
					"•	Inflammation of the bile ducts (sclerosing cholangitis)"
					"•	Tumours of the pancreas, gallbladder, bile duct, liver"
					"•	Enlarged lymph nodes in the region of the pancreas and liver due to various types of tumours"
					"•	Traumatic bile duct rupture or Injury to bile ducts during surgery."

				"Biliary drainage relieves obstruction by providing an alternative pathway to exit the liver. "
				"Biliary drainage may also be necessary if a hole develops in the bile duct, resulting in leakage of bile into the abdominal cavity.  This leak may cause severe pain and infection.  Biliary drainage stops the leak and helps the hole in the bile duct to heal. "
				"Biliary drainage may be necessary in preparation for surgery or other procedure on the bile ducts, such as removal of a bile duct stone or tumour.",

		question: "What happens after the procedure?",
		answer: "You will be taken back to your ward where your blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen levels and temperature are monitored regularly.  You will be on best rest for a few hours until you have recovered.  It is important to take care of the drainage bag so that the catheter does not get pulled out.  The nurses will empty the drainage bag at regular intervals and record the drainage output. If you are discharged with the catheter and bag in place, the nursing staff will teach you how to care for the catheter at home, such as how to empty the bag and change the dressing",
		imagePath: "../img/card1.jpg"
	},
	{
		id: 6,
		question: "Are there any risks or complications of the procedure?",
		answer: "Although biliary drainage is a relatively safe technique, there are potential risks as with any procedure.  Occasionally, it may not be possible to place the drain in the bile duct, in which case surgery may be required to relieve the blockage.  Sometimes the bile may leak around the catheter and form a collection in the abdomen that can cause pain and may require drainage.  Occasionally, the procedure can cause a blood infection (septicaemia) but prophylactic antibiotics are given to reduce this risk. Occasionally, bleeding may be a problem that requires a blood transfusion.  Rarely, bleeding can be more severe and an embolisation procedure or surgical operation may be necessary. "
 				"With regards to biliary stents, they may be misplaced at the time of the procedure or may migrate following the procedure.  These can be rectified by placement of a second stent in the correct place."
