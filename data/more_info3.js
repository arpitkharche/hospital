		question: "What is TIPSS?",
		answer: "The best way of describing what TIPSS is, is to explain what the letters stand for."+
				"\n T is for TRANSJUGULAR. This means that the radiologist will put a fine, hollow needle into the jugular vein in your neck while you are asleep. Through this needle he, or she, will pass a fine, thin wire in a straight line until it reaches the veins from your liver. This is much easier than you would imagine. Over this wire the radiologist will pass a fine plastic tube called a catheter, about the size of a very long piece of spaghetti."+
				"\n I is for INTRAHEPATIC. The catheter that the radiologist has inserted will be passed down one of your liver veins into the liver itself. The radiologist will then take the wire out and insert a long curved needle."+
				"\n PS is for PORTO-SYSTEMIC. The long needle will be pushed from your liver vein, (or SYSTEMIC vein) into your PORTAL vein, which lies close to it. It is this portal vein which has become partially blocked up by your liver disease. Because of the blockage, there is high blood pressure in this part of your circulation, and this procedure is designed to relieve this."+
				"\n S is for SHUNT. Once the needle has been passed between your liver vein and the portal vein, a wire will be passed through the needle and the needle withdrawn. Over the wire the radiologist will pass a metal spring called a stent. This stent will expand to create a channel between the two veins. Blood will then flow from the high-pressure portal vein into the low-pressure liver (or systemic) vein. The high pressure in the portal vein which is causing your problem, will consequently be reduced, back towards ",

		question: "Why do I need a TIPSS?",
		answer: "Normally, the nutrients in food are absorbed from the bowel, and carried back in blood vessels towards the liver. The largest of these vessels is called the portal vein. Once the nutrients reach the liver, they can be stored and then used. The liver also removes waste products. The disease in your liver is blocking the flow of blood like a dam, and is causing the blood pressure in the portal vein to rise. Because of this, you may have developed extra veins inside your abdomen, like varicose veins, which may have bled into your stomach, or your gullet. You may have vomited blood. You may also have excessive fluid inside your abdomen. Your gastro-enterologist or your surgeon will have tried other methods of stopping the bleeding, or lowering this high portal blood pressure. These probably have not worked. An open operation is possible to divert blood in the portal vein and lower the pressure, and this produces the same result as a TIPSS does. However, the open operation is considered much more dangerous than TIPSS. It is possible that you are also being considered for a liver transplant.",

		question: "Who will be doing the TIPSS?",
		answer: "A specially trained doctor called an interventional radiologist will carry out the TIPSS. Interventional radiologists have specialist expertise in using X-ray and scanning equipment and also in interpreting the images produced. They need to look at these images while carrying out the procedure.",

		question: "What actually happens during a TIPSS? ",
		answer: "You will be taken down to the X-ray department on a trolley. You need to have a needle put into a vein in your arm or hand, so that you can have intravenous sedatives or painkillers. Once in place, this needle does not hurt. In the X-ray department the anaesthetist, who you will have met already, will put you to sleep. However, if it has been decided not to use a general anaesthetic, then do not worry. An anaesthetist, or the radiologist and other trained staff, will make certain that you are heavily sedated so that you do not feel any pain, and do not remember the procedure. Once you are asleep, you will be monitored throughout the procedure and given oxygen. The interventional radiologist will keep everything sterile, and will wear a theatre gown and operating gloves. The skin of your neck will be cleaned with antiseptic and the rest of your body will be covered with a theatre towel. When you wake up, if you have had a general anaesthetic you will be in the theatre recovery area. You will have a small needle in your arm, or hand, probably with a bag of fluid attached to it. You may feel some stiffness in your neck where the needle has been inserted.",

		question: "Will it hurt?",
		answer: "If you have a general anaesthetic, apart from having a small needle put into the back of your hand, you should not feel any pain and you should not remember the procedure. In the same way, you should not feel any pain if you are sedated. There will be a nurse, or another member of staff, standing next to you and looking after you. If you are aware of any pain, then you can let them know, and they will arrange for you to have more painkillers or sedatives through the needle in your arm.",

		question: "How long will it take?",

		question: "Is TIPSS permanent and what happens next?",
		answer: "The stent that the radiologist has put in between your liver vein and your portal vein will stay in for the rest of your life. It can, however, become blocked and in order to prevent this the radiologist will ask you to attend the X-ray department regularly for ultrasound examinations to check your liver. With ultrasound, the radiologist will be able to see the TIPSS and see if it is becoming blocked. If at any time he or she thinks it is, they will ask you to come to the X-ray department for a day and will perform a very simple procedure to unblock the TIPSS. This procedure will not require a general anaesthetic. If you are having a liver transplant, then the radiologist will check the TIPSS until you have your transplant. If you are not having a liver transplant, you may have to come for regular checks for at least five years.",
